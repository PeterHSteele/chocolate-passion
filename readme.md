A blogging or small business theme.

== Description ==

This theme is probably best used for a blog or some other kind of personal website. It hooks into
WooCommerce to provide mom-and-pop scale ecommerce functionality.

Two "features" which might need short explanations:
* You can alter the way posts appear on index pages, namely the blog/posts page and taxonomy
pages, by setting the 'chocolate_passion_post_view' custom field to 'background_image' in the 
post editor. It's important that any post that does this has a featured image.
*You can add panels, consisting of a large image with text layered on top, to a page on your site 
by selecting the panel page template. The other page templates should be self-explanatory.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
