A blogging or small business theme.

== Description ==

This theme is probably best used for a blog or some other kind of personal website. It hooks into
WooCommerce to provide mom-and-pop scale ecommerce functionality.

Two "features" which might need short explanations:
* You can alter the way posts appear on index pages, namely the blog/posts page and taxonomy
pages, by choosing the background image template in the post editor. This template only affects posts 
that appear in lists and will not affect the "single" view of the post. It's best that any 
post that uses this template has a featured image.

* You can add panels, consisting of a large image with text layered on top, to a page on your site 
by selecting the panel page template. You can also include these panels on your blog page by navigating 
to your blog page and checking the box in the CP Panels customizer section.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload Theme and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.
